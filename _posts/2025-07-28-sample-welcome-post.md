Welcome to the **Educator Blog** — a space for teachers navigating the exciting, complex journey of integrating technology and AI into English teaching.

This blog is a moderated community space. Educators from around the world will be invited to share their stories, reflections, and ideas here — all reviewed and approved before publishing.

Check back soon for new voices, practical strategies, and honest reflections on what works (and what doesn’t) in the AI-enhanced classroom. We can't wait to hear from you!
